A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Implement a calculator for calculating the acceleration in an equal acceleration motion. The first screen should have 3 numeric input fields (initial velocity, final velocity and time) and a check-box for data processing consent. Implement validation of the fields and the checkbox. Transfer the data from the first screen to the second screen, calculate and display.
